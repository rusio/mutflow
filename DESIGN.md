# mutflow - Design Document

## Overview

mutflow is a Kotlin compiler plugin for lightweight, low-overhead mutation testing. It targets developers and teams who currently do no mutation testing due to the high cost and complexity of traditional tools.

## The Problem

Traditional mutation testing (e.g., Pitest) works by:
1. Generating mutants (modified versions of code)
2. Compiling each mutant separately
3. Running tests against each mutant
4. Reporting which mutants survived

This is thorough but **expensive**: many compilation cycles, long execution times, complex tooling setup. Most teams skip mutation testing entirely.

## The Approach: Mutant Schemata

mutflow uses the "mutant schemata" (or "meta-mutant") technique:

1. **Compile once**: The compiler plugin injects ALL mutation variants into the code at compile time, guarded by conditional switches
2. **Runtime selection**: At test runtime, a control mechanism activates exactly one mutation per run
3. **Multiple runs**: Tests execute multiple times — once as baseline, then with different single mutations
4. **Fail on survivors**: If a mutant survives (tests pass when they shouldn't), the test fails with actionable feedback

### Example Transformation

**Test code:**
```kotlin
@MutFlowTest
class CalculatorTest {
    @Test
    fun testIsPositive() {
        val result = MutFlow.underTest {  // parameterless with JUnit extension
            isPositive(5)
        }
        assertTrue(result)
    }
}
```

**Production code — before:**
```kotlin
@MutationTarget
class Calculator {
    fun isPositive(x: Int): Boolean {
        return x > 0
    }
}
```

**Production code — after compiler plugin:**
```kotlin
@MutationTarget
class Calculator {
    fun isPositive(x: Int): Boolean {
        // Compiler injects nested when expressions for multiple mutation types
        return when (MutationRegistry.check(
            pointId = "sample.Calculator_0",
            variantCount = 2,
            sourceLocation = "Calculator.kt:4",
            originalOperator = ">",
            variantOperators = ">=,<",
            occurrenceOnLine = 1
        )) {
            0 -> x >= 0  // operator mutation: include equality
            1 -> x < 0   // operator mutation: direction flip
            else -> when (MutationRegistry.check(
                pointId = "sample.Calculator_1",
                variantCount = 2,
                sourceLocation = "Calculator.kt:4",
                originalOperator = "0",
                variantOperators = "1,-1",
                occurrenceOnLine = 1
            )) {
                0 -> x > 1   // constant mutation: increment
                1 -> x > -1  // constant mutation: decrement
                else -> x > 0  // original
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This nested structure is generated recursively by the compiler plugin. Each matching `MutationOperator` wraps the expression, with the `else` branch feeding into the next operator. Since only one mutation is active at runtime, there's no complexity — the active mutation's branch executes, all others fall through to original.

### Runtime Discovery Model

Mutation points are discovered **dynamically at runtime**, not statically at class load:

1. **Discovery run**: Code executes normally (no `activeMutation`). Each `MutationRegistry.check()` call registers "I exist with these variants" along with display metadata (source location, operator descriptions), and returns `null` (use original). After execution, the registry returns: *"discovered 5 mutation points with their variant counts"*.

**Note:** Point IDs use the format `ClassName_N` (e.g., `sample.Calculator_0`), but display names show source location and operator (e.g., `(Calculator.kt:7) > → >=`). When the same operator appears multiple times on the same line (e.g., `if (a > b && c > d)`), an occurrence suffix disambiguates: the first stays `> → >=`, the second becomes `> → >= #2`. A future improvement is switching to IR-hash based IDs for stability across refactoring.

2. **Mutation runs**: The caller specifies which mutation to activate via `ActiveMutation(pointId, variantIndex)`. When that point calls `check()`, it returns the active variant index instead of `null`.

This dynamic discovery matters because:
- Different `underTest` blocks exercise different code paths
- Only mutations actually reached by the test are counted
- Same class called from different tests may hit different mutation points

## Key Features

### 1. Explicit Test Scoping with `MutFlow.underTest`

Tests explicitly mark the action under test using BDD-style structure:

```kotlin
@MutFlowTest
class CalculatorTest {
    @Test
    fun testIsPositive() {
        // given
        val x = 5

        // when
        val result = MutFlow.underTest {  // parameterless when using @MutFlowTest
            isPositive(x)
        }

        // then
        assertTrue(result)
    }
}
```

The `MutFlow.underTest` block:
- Wraps only the action under test (the "when" in given/when/then)
- Returns the result for assertions outside the block
- Assertions stay outside — they should fail when mutations change behavior
- When using `@MutFlowTest`, the JUnit extension manages session lifecycle internally

### 2. Global Baseline and Run Model

Mutation testing operates at the **test class level** with a global registry:

1. **Run 0 (baseline)**: ALL test cases in the class execute first, discovering mutation points
2. **Run 1+**: ALL test cases execute with the **same mutation** active

```kotlin
// With @MutFlowTest, the JUnit extension orchestrates all runs automatically:
// - Run 0 (baseline): All tests execute, mutation points discovered
// - Run 1+: All tests execute with same mutation active

@MutFlowTest
class CalculatorTest {
    @Test fun testIsPositive() {
        val result = MutFlow.underTest { calculator.isPositive(5) }
        assertTrue(result)
    }

    @Test fun testIsNegative() {
        val result = MutFlow.underTest { calculator.isPositive(-5) }
        assertFalse(result)
    }
}

// If ANY test fails during a mutation run, the mutation is killed
```

**Key principles:**
- **Same mutation for all tests**: A run activates one mutation across the entire test suite
- **Global discovery**: Mutation points from all tests are merged into a single registry
- **Touch counting**: During baseline, we count how many tests touch each mutation point
- **Run limit**: Tests run up to N times (configured), or until all mutations are exhausted

This means:
- We can determine if a mutation **survives the entire test suite**
- Mutations touched by fewer tests are identified as higher risk
- Precise feedback: when a mutant survives, you know exactly which one

### 3. Selection and Shuffle Modes (Internal)

These are internal implementation details used by the mutation selection engine. The `@MutFlowTest` annotation uses `MostLikelyStable` + `PerChange` by default and runs all mutations. These parameters are only exposed through the manual `MutFlow.underTest(run, selection, shuffle)` API.

Mutation selection is controlled by two orthogonal parameters:

```kotlin
enum class Selection {
    PureRandom,       // Uniform random selection
    MostLikelyRandom, // Weighted random favoring least-touched points
    MostLikelyStable  // Deterministic: always pick least-touched point
}

enum class Shuffle {
    PerRun,    // Different seed each CI build/JVM run
    PerChange  // Same seed until discovered points change
}
```

**Selection strategies** (which mutation to pick):

| Selection | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| `PureRandom` | Uniform random selection among untested mutations |
| `MostLikelyRandom` | Random but weighted toward mutations touched by fewer tests |
| `MostLikelyStable` | Deterministically pick the mutation touched by fewest tests |

The "touch count" is calculated during baseline (run 0): each time a test executes a mutation point, that point's touch count increments. Mutations touched by fewer tests are considered higher risk and prioritized by `MostLikely*` strategies.

**Shuffle modes** (when to change the seed):

| Shuffle | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| `PerRun` | New random seed each JVM/CI run — exploratory |
| `PerChange` | Seed based on `hash(discoveredPoints)` — stable until code changes |

**Typical workflow:**
1. During development: use `MostLikelyRandom` + `PerRun` to explore high-risk mutations
2. For merge requests: use `MostLikelyStable` + `PerChange` for reproducible results
3. Over time: cover all mutations across many builds

### 4. Global Mutation Registry

The mutation registry is a **global in-memory state** shared across all tests:

```kotlin
GlobalRegistry {
    // From baseline (run 0): which points exist and their variant counts
    discoveredPoints: Map<PointId, VariantCount>

    // From baseline (run 0): how many tests touched each point
    touchCounts: Map<PointId, Int>

    // Updated each mutation run: which mutations have been tested
    testedMutations: Set<Mutation>  // Mutation = (pointId, variantIndex)
}
```

**Lifecycle:**
1. **Run 0 (all tests)**: Baseline discovery — mutation points merged globally, touch counts accumulated
2. **Run 1+**: For each run:
   - Select a mutation point (using Selection strategy + touch counts)
   - Pick a variant for that point (excluding already-tested variants)
   - Add to `testedMutations`, activate, execute lambda
3. **Exhaustion**: If no untested mutations remain → throw `MutationsExhaustedException`

This ensures:
- No mutation is tested twice within an execution
- Touch counts guide selection toward under-tested mutation points
- Natural termination when all mutations are covered
- Run count (configured in JUnit) is the normal limit; exception is early-exit for small codebases

### 5. Trapping Surviving Mutants

When a mutant survives, the build fails with a display name like:
```
MUTANT SURVIVED: (Calculator.kt:8) > → >=
```

This display name can be copied into the `@MutFlowTest` annotation to **trap** the mutant — ensuring it runs first every time while you fix the test gap:

```kotlin
@MutFlowTest(
    traps = ["(Calculator.kt:8) > → >="]
)
class CalculatorTest {
    @Test
    fun testIsPositive() {
        val result = MutFlow.underTest { calculator.isPositive(5) }
        assertTrue(result)
    }
}
```

Traps are a **temporary debugging aid**:
1. Mutation survives → you get its display name
2. Copy display name into `traps` array to pin it
3. Fix your test until it catches the mutation
4. Remove the trap once fixed

**Trap behavior:**
- Trapped mutations run **first**, before normal selection (regardless of selection strategy)
- Multiple traps run in the order provided
- After all traps are exhausted, normal selection continues
- Invalid traps (e.g., code moved) print a warning with available mutations

**Why display names instead of internal IDs?** The display name format `(FileName.kt:line) original → variant` (or `… variant #N` when disambiguating) is:
- Human-readable and self-documenting in test code
- Directly copy-pasteable from survivor output
- Stable enough for temporary debugging (users typically change tests, not impl)
- Easy to update if code moves (the warning shows available mutations)
- Unambiguous even when the same operator appears multiple times on one line

### 6. Scoped Mutations via Annotations and Gradle Config

The compiler plugin injects mutations into classes that are either annotated with `@MutationTarget` or matched by target patterns configured in the Gradle plugin:

```kotlin
// Option 1: Annotation on production code
@MutationTarget
class Calculator {
    // mutations injected here
}

// Option 2: Gradle config (no annotation needed on production code)
// build.gradle.kts
mutflow {
    targets = listOf(
        "com.example.Calculator",       // exact class
        "com.example.service.*",        // all classes in a package
        "com.example.service.**",       // package + all subpackages
        "com.example.*Service"          // glob pattern
    )
}
```

Both mechanisms can be combined freely — a class is mutated if it matches either `@MutationTarget` or a Gradle target pattern. If both match the same class, it is simply mutated once (no duplication).

**Why two mechanisms?**
- `@MutationTarget` is convenient for small projects and makes mutation scope visible in the code
- Gradle config addresses a common concern: annotating production code with test-related annotations from an external library feels invasive (see [GitHub issue #2](https://github.com/anschnapp/mutflow/issues/2)). The Gradle config keeps all mutation testing configuration in the test/build layer

**Pattern matching:** Target patterns support glob-style matching:
- `.` matches literal dots in package/class names
- `*` matches a single name segment (does not cross dots)
- `**` matches any number of segments (crosses dots)

Patterns are compiled to regexes once at plugin initialization and matched against each class's fully qualified name during IR transformation.

This limits bytecode bloat and keeps mutations relevant.

Additionally, you can suppress mutations on specific functions using `@SuppressMutations`:

```kotlin
@MutationTarget
class Calculator {
    fun isPositive(x: Int) = x > 0  // mutations injected

    @SuppressMutations
    fun debugLog(x: Int): Boolean {
        // no mutations here - logging code doesn't need mutation testing
        return x > 100
    }
}
```

The `@SuppressMutations` annotation can be applied to:
- **Classes**: Skip all mutations in the entire class
- **Functions**: Skip mutations in specific functions only

#### Line-Level Suppression via Comments

For finer granularity, individual lines can be suppressed using comments — similar to SonarQube's `// NOSONAR`. Two keywords are supported with the same technical effect but different semantic intent:

- `mutflow:ignore` — the code is not worth testing (logging, debug utilities, heuristics)
- `mutflow:falsePositive` — the mutation is an equivalent mutant or not meaningful to test

Free-form text after the keyword serves as documentation for reviewers.

**Inline comment** — suppresses mutations on the same line:
```kotlin
val threshold = x > 100 // mutflow:ignore this is just a heuristic threshold
```

**Standalone comment** — suppresses mutations on the next line:
```kotlin
// mutflow:falsePositive equivalent mutant, >= and > both valid here
if (retryCount > MAX_RETRIES) { ... }
```

**How it works:**
1. The IR transformer reads the source file when entering a `@MutationTarget` class
2. Lines containing `mutflow:ignore` or `mutflow:falsePositive` after `//` are parsed
3. A set of suppressed line numbers is built (inline = same line, standalone = next line)
4. Mutation operators skip IR nodes whose source line falls in the suppressed set
5. Source file reads are cached per file path (no re-reading for multiple classes in the same file)

**Zero production overhead:** Comments are stripped by the Kotlin compiler — nothing appears in production bytecode. The suppression logic runs entirely during compilation.

**Defensive behavior:** If the source file cannot be read (e.g., generated sources, unusual build setups), a warning is printed and compilation continues without comment-based suppression:
```
[mutflow] WARNING: Could not read source file Calculator.kt — comment-based suppression (mutflow:ignore / mutflow:falsePositive) unavailable for this file
```

**Why not a function call or annotation?** A function call like `ignoreMutationsForNextLine()` would leave a no-op call in production bytecode (the compiler plugin only runs during test compilation in the dual-build setup). Annotations cannot target individual expressions/lines in Kotlin. Comments are zero-cost and familiar from tools like SonarQube and PMD.

### 7. Target Filtering for Integration Tests

In integration tests, `MutFlow.underTest {}` blocks often exercise multiple `@MutationTarget` classes, but you may only care about mutations in the class you're actually testing. Target filtering lets you scope which classes produce active mutations:

```kotlin
// Only test mutations from Calculator (ignore Logger, AuditService, etc.)
@MutFlowTest(includeTargets = [Calculator::class])
class CalculatorIntegrationTest { ... }

// Test mutations from everything except infrastructure classes
@MutFlowTest(excludeTargets = [AuditLogger::class, MetricsService::class])
class PaymentServiceTest { ... }
```

**How it works:**
- `includeTargets`: Only mutations from these `@MutationTarget` classes are selected. Empty (default) = all classes included.
- `excludeTargets`: Mutations from these classes are skipped. Empty (default) = no classes excluded.
- Both can be combined: include narrows the set first, then exclude removes from it.

**Key design decisions:**
- **Discovery is unfiltered**: All mutation points are still discovered during baseline (touch counts remain accurate for selection weighting)
- **Filtering applies at selection time**: Only when picking which mutation to activate next
- **Summary reflects the filter**: Total/untested counts only show filtered mutations, so "all mutations tested" means "all mutations you care about"
- **Exhaustion respects the filter**: The session exhausts when all *filtered* mutations are tested, not all discovered mutations

**Why class-level filtering?** Point IDs encode the fully qualified class name (e.g., `com.example.Calculator_0`), so class-based matching is natural. The annotation uses `KClass<*>` references, which are type-safe and refactoring-friendly.

### 8. Partial Run Detection

When running a single test method from an IDE (e.g., IntelliJ's "Run Test" on one method), mutation testing is automatically skipped. This prevents false positives — mutations that would be killed by *other* tests in the class would incorrectly appear as survivors.

**How it works:**
1. At session creation, the extension counts `@Test` methods in the class
2. During baseline, each executed test is tracked
3. After baseline, if `executedTests < expectedTests`, mutation runs are skipped

**Example output when running a single test:**
```
[mutflow] Starting baseline run (discovery)
[mutflow] Discovered mutation point: (Calculator.kt:7) > with 2 variants
[mutflow] Partial test run detected (1/3 tests) - skipping mutation testing
```

The baseline still runs normally (tests execute, mutations are discovered), but no mutation runs occur. This ensures you get your test results quickly without misleading mutation feedback.

**Rationale:** Mutation testing evaluates the *entire test suite's* ability to catch mutations. Running it with a subset produces meaningless results — better to skip and provide a clear message.

### 9. Timeout Detection for Infinite Loops

Certain mutations can cause infinite loops — most commonly when flipping a relational operator in a loop condition (e.g., `<` → `>` in `while (i < n)`). Without protection, these mutations would hang the test run indefinitely.

mutflow detects this at the compiler level by injecting `MutationRegistry.checkTimeout()` at the top of every loop body in `@MutationTarget` classes:

```kotlin
// Before compiler plugin
while (i < n) {
    process(i)
    i++
}

// After compiler plugin (in addition to mutation point injection)
while (i < n) {
    MutationRegistry.checkTimeout()  // injected
    process(i)
    i++
}
```

**How it works:**
1. When a mutation run starts, `MutationRegistry.withSession()` computes a deadline: `System.nanoTime() + timeoutMs * 1_000_000`
2. Each loop iteration calls `checkTimeout()`, which compares current time against the deadline
3. If exceeded, throws `MutationTimedOutException` — the test **fails** with a message suggesting `// mutflow:ignore`
4. The timed-out mutation is recorded as `MutationResult.TimedOut` and shown in the summary

**Performance characteristics of `checkTimeout()`:**
- **No active session** (production code): immediate `null` check return — effectively zero cost
- **Baseline run** (no active mutation): `deadlineNanos == 0` check — fast return
- **Mutation run**: one `System.nanoTime()` call per loop iteration (~20-30ns on modern JVMs)

**Why compiler-injected checks instead of thread-based timeout?**
A `Future.get(timeout)` approach can detect timeouts but cannot stop tight CPU-bound infinite loops — `Thread.interrupt()` only works if the loop checks interruption (most don't). The compiler-injected approach cleanly breaks even tight loops like `while(true) { counter++ }` from within.

**Loop coverage:**
All loop types in Kotlin compile to `IrWhileLoop` or `IrDoWhileLoop` in IR:

| Kotlin source | IR node | Covered? |
|---|---|---|
| `while (...)` | `IrWhileLoop` | Yes |
| `do { ... } while (...)` | `IrDoWhileLoop` | Yes |
| `for (i in ...)` | `IrWhileLoop` (desugared) | Yes |
| `forEach { }`, `map { }`, etc. | `IrCall` (stdlib function) | No — but loop control is in stdlib, not user code |

Higher-order function "loops" like `forEach` can't cause infinite loops from mutations because the loop control (`hasNext()`, counter) lives in the stdlib, not in the mutated code.

**Configuration:**
```kotlin
@MutFlowTest(timeoutMs = 60_000)  // default: 60 seconds, 0 to disable
class CalculatorTest { ... }
```

**Design rationale — fail loudly, not silently:**
When a timeout occurs, the test **fails** rather than silently marking the mutation as killed. This ensures the developer notices and takes action (adds `// mutflow:ignore` on the affected line). Silent handling would mask slow mutation runs that accumulate over time.

```

The `mutflow-core` module contains the bridge between compiler-generated code and test
runtime. Both sides depend on it, but not on each other, keeping coupling minimal.

### Session-Based Architecture

State is scoped to sessions rather than being globally mutable:

```kotlin
// JUnit extension creates session at class start
val sessionId = MutFlow.createSession(selection, shuffle, maxRuns)

// Each class template invocation:
val mutation = MutFlow.selectMutationForRun(sessionId, run)  // null for baseline
MutFlow.startRun(sessionId, run, mutation)
// ... all tests execute ...
MutFlow.endRun(sessionId)

// JUnit extension closes session when class finishes
MutFlow.closeSession(sessionId)
```

Benefits:
- **Clean lifecycle**: create → runs → close
- **State isolation**: Each test class has its own session
- **No leaked state**: Explicit cleanup
- **Thread-safe routing**: `startRun` registers the calling thread to the session; parameterless `underTest {}` resolves the session by thread ID
- **Synchronized mutation execution**: `MutationRegistry.withSession()` ensures only one `underTest {}` block executes at a time

### Test Framework Adapters

The JUnit extension (`mutflow-junit6`) is intentionally a thin adapter:
- Uses JUnit 6's `@ClassTemplate` mechanism to run the class multiple times
- `MutFlowExtension` implements `ClassTemplateInvocationContextProvider`
- All orchestration logic lives in `mutflow-runtime` (session management, mutation selection)
- Extension only handles: session creation/cleanup, run start/end calls, display names

This keeps framework-specific code minimal (~100 lines) and enables easy porting to other frameworks.

### Data Flow

```
1. Compile time:
   ┌──────────────────┐      ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ x > 0            │ ───► │ when(registry.check(pointId, 2, "Calc.kt:7", ">", │
   └──────────────────┘      │                     ">=,<", occurrenceOnLine=1))  │
                             └───────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

2. Baseline (run=0) — ALL tests run first:

   Test A: underTest(run=0, selection, shuffle) { calculator.isPositive(5) }
        │
        ▼
   registry.check("sample.Calculator_0", 2) → registers point, touchCount++, returns null
   registry.check("sample.Calculator_1", 2) → registers point, touchCount++, returns null
        │
        ▼
   Returns: block result (T)

   Test B: underTest(run=0, selection, shuffle) { calculator.validate(-1) }
        │
        ▼
   registry.check("sample.Calculator_0", 2) → already known, touchCount++, returns null
   registry.check("sample.Validator_0", 2) → registers point, touchCount++, returns null
        │
        ▼
   Returns: block result (T)

   After all run=0 complete:
   GlobalRegistry {
       discoveredPoints: {sample.Calculator_0: 2, sample.Calculator_1: 2, sample.Validator_0: 2}
       touchCounts: {sample.Calculator_0: 2, sample.Calculator_1: 1, sample.Validator_0: 1}
       testedMutations: {}
   }

3. Mutation runs (run=1, 2, ...) — ALL tests run with SAME mutation:

   First underTest(run=1, selection=MostLikelyRandom, shuffle=PerChange):
        │
        ▼
   Select point: sample.Calculator_1 (lowest touch count, weighted random)
   Select variant: 0 (from range 0..1)
   Add (sample.Calculator_1, 0) to testedMutations
   Activate mutation (sample.Calculator_1, 0)
        │
        ▼
   All tests execute with (sample.Calculator_1, 0) active:
   registry.check("sample.Calculator_0", ...) → not active, returns null
   registry.check("sample.Calculator_1", ...) → active! returns 0
   registry.check("sample.Validator_0", ...) → not active, returns null
        │
        ▼
   If ANY test fails → mutation killed
   If ALL tests pass → mutation survived, report it

4. Exhaustion:
   underTest(run=N, ...) where all mutations tested
        │
        ▼
   No untested mutations remain
        │
        ▼
   Throws MutationsExhaustedException → JUnit stops iteration
```

## Technical Decisions

### Disabling Mutation Testing

The Gradle plugin exposes a `mutflow` extension with an `enabled` property (default: `true`). When set to `false`:

1. **No `mutatedMain` source set** is created — no extra compilation step
2. **No compiler plugin** is registered (`isApplicable` returns `false`)
3. **Only `mutflow-annotations` and `mutflow-junit6`** are added as dependencies, so `@MutationTarget` and `@MutFlowTest` still compile
4. **Tests run normally** but discover 0 mutations (no `MutationRegistry.check()` calls exist in the code)

The property supports three configuration methods with the following precedence:
- **DSL** (`mutflow { enabled = false }`) — highest, set explicitly in build script
- **Gradle property** (`-Pmutflow.enabled=false` or `gradle.properties`) — used as convention (default) if DSL value is not set

This is useful for:
- CI pipelines where mutation testing only runs on specific builds (e.g., nightly, not on every push)
- Local development when fast iteration is needed
- Temporarily disabling without removing the plugin from the build

### Kotlin K2 Only
- K1 is deprecated; K2 is the future
- Maintaining both is too much overhead for an experimental project
- By the time mutflow matures, K2 will be standard

### Test Build Only
The compiler plugin is applied ONLY to test compilation, never production:
- Gradle plugin applies to `testCompile` tasks only
- Runtime guards detect non-test context and fail fast
- Build verification can scan production artifacts for mutation markers

### Thread Safety and Parallel Test Execution

`MutationRegistry` is a singleton with a single `currentSession` slot — only one mutation session can be active at a time. This is a fundamental constraint of the mutant schemata approach: compiler-injected `MutationRegistry.check()` calls have no session context, so they read from a global.

**Why not ThreadLocal?** Using `ThreadLocal` for the session would break coroutines (suspend functions can resume on different dispatcher threads) and reactive frameworks (operators run on scheduler threads). We intentionally avoid `ThreadLocal` to keep these doors open for future support.

**Current approach: synchronized `withSession`**

`MutationRegistry.withSession()` wraps the entire session lifecycle in a `synchronized` block:

```kotlin
synchronized(lock) {
    currentSession = Session(activeMutation)
    try {
        val result = block()  // production code executes, check() calls read currentSession
        return result to buildSessionResult()
    } finally {
        currentSession = null
    }
}
```

This means `underTest {}` blocks from different test classes serialize at the `MutationRegistry` level. Between these blocks (test setup, assertions, Spring context initialization, non-mutation tests), everything runs freely in parallel.

**Session routing via thread-to-session map**

Each test class has its own `MutFlowSession`, but the parameterless `MutFlow.underTest {}` API needs to find the right session without a session ID parameter. Since JUnit runs `startRun`, test methods, and `endRun` on the same thread:

- `MutFlow.startRun(sessionId)` registers `Thread.currentThread().id → sessionId`
- `MutFlow.underTest {}` looks up the session by current thread ID
- `MutFlow.endRun(sessionId)` deregisters the thread

This is not a `ThreadLocal` — it's an explicit `ConcurrentHashMap<Long, String>` used only for test-thread routing. The coroutine concern doesn't apply here because `underTest()` is always called from the test thread, before entering the `withSession` synchronized block where production code (potentially using coroutines) executes.

**Summary of parallel behavior:**
- Non-mutation test classes: fully parallel, unaffected
- Mutation test classes: `underTest {}` blocks serialize; everything else (setup, assertions) is parallel
- Coroutines/reactive inside `underTest {}`: works correctly (lock is held for the entire block)

## Tradeoffs and Limitations

### Scope: Coverage vs Assertion Quality

mutflow closes the gap between code coverage and assertion quality - it doesn't replace coverage tools.

- **Coverage tools** answer: "Was this code executed?"
- **mutflow** answers: "Do your assertions catch behavioral changes?"

Code only reached outside `MutFlow.underTest { }` blocks produces no mutations. This can be good (setup code, logging) or bad (forgot to wrap the action under test). Use coverage tools to ensure code is exercised; use mutflow to ensure your assertions are meaningful.

### Advantages
- **Low overhead**: Compile once, not once per mutant
- **Low friction**: No separate tool, runs in normal tests
- **Reproducible**: Seed-based determinism, trapped mutations for debugging
- **Pragmatic**: "Some mutation testing > none" philosophy

### Limitations
- **Not exhaustive per session**: Each session tests a small fixed number of mutations (3-8), not all. Coverage grows over many builds.
- **Bytecode bloat**: Injected branches increase class size (64KB method limit is a risk)
- **Coverage interference**: Extra branches affect coverage reports (may need separate non-mutated build)
- **Debugging complexity**: Stack traces through mutated code can be confusing
- **Equivalent mutants**: Some mutations produce identical behavior (noise)
- **Shared state**: Sequential mutation runs may need state invalidation (future: user-provided hooks)

### What mutflow adds
- Kotlin-native K2 compiler plugin (not Java tooling adapted for Kotlin)
- BDD-style `MutFlow.underTest` API for explicit test scoping
- One mutation per run for precise feedback
- Trap mechanism to pin surviving mutants while fixing test gaps
- IR-hash based mutation point identification (stable across refactoring)

## Implementation Status

### What's Built

**mutflow-core:**
- `MutationRegistry` with `check()`, `checkTimeout()`, `startSession()`, `endSession()`, `withSession()` API
- `withSession()`: synchronized wrapper that ensures only one mutation session is active at a time
- `checkTimeout()`: compiler-injected loop guard that throws `MutationTimedOutException` when deadline exceeded
- Supporting types (`ActiveMutation`, `DiscoveredPoint`, `SessionResult`)
- `@MutationTarget` annotation for scoping mutations
- Occurrence-on-line tracking for disambiguating duplicate operators on the same source line

**mutflow-compiler-plugin:**
- K2 compiler plugin with extensible mutation operator mechanism
- `MutflowCommandLineProcessor` receives target patterns from Gradle plugin via `SubpluginOption`
- Target pattern matching: glob-style patterns (`*`, `**`) compiled to regex for FQN matching
- Four operator interfaces for different IR node types:
  - `MutationOperator` — for `IrCall` nodes (comparison operators, etc.)
  - `ReturnMutationOperator` — for `IrReturn` nodes (return statement mutations)
  - `FunctionBodyMutationOperator` — for function declarations (body-level mutations)
  - `WhenMutationOperator` — for `IrWhen` nodes (boolean logic operators)
- `RelationalComparisonOperator` handles all comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`)
  - Each operator produces 2 variants: boundary mutation + direction flip
- `ConstantBoundaryOperator` mutates numeric constants in comparisons
  - Produces 2 variants: +1 and -1 of the original constant
  - Detects poorly tested boundaries that operator mutations miss
- `BooleanReturnOperator` mutates boolean return values
  - Produces 2 variants: `true` and `false`
  - Only matches explicit return statements (block-bodied functions)
  - Skips synthetic returns from expression-bodied functions (detected by zero-width source span)
- `NullableReturnOperator` mutates nullable return values to null
  - Produces 1 variant: `null`
  - Only matches explicit return statements in functions with nullable return types
  - Skips returns that are already null (mutating null to null is pointless)
  - Catches tests that only verify non-null without checking the actual value
- `ArithmeticOperator` mutates arithmetic operations
  - `+` → `-` (1 variant)
  - `-` → `+` (1 variant)
  - `*` → `/` (1 variant, with safe division to avoid div-by-zero)
  - `/` → `*` (1 variant)
  - `%` → `/` (1 variant)
  - Safe division for `*` → `/`: when b=0, computes b/a; when both are 0, returns 1
- `EqualitySwapOperator` swaps equality operators
  - `==` → `!=` (1 variant: wraps EQEQ intrinsic with `Boolean.not()`)
  - `!=` → `==` (1 variant: unwraps the `not()` wrapper to expose the inner EQEQ call)
  - In K2 IR, `==` is a single EQEQ intrinsic; `!=` is `not(EQEQ(a, b))` — two calls both with EXCLEQ origin
  - Matches EQEQ calls with EQEQ origin for `==`, and `not()` calls with EXCLEQ origin for `!=`
  - Avoids double-matching the inner EQEQ of `!=` expressions (which would create spurious mutation points)
- `BooleanInversionOperator` adds negation to boolean expressions
  - `expr` → `!expr` (1 variant: wraps in `Boolean.not()`)
  - Matches boolean-returning `IrCall` nodes with null or `GET_PROPERTY` origin (function calls and property accesses)
  - Excludes `not()` calls (would create redundant double-negation points) and EXCLEQ origin (handled by EqualitySwapOperator)
  - The "remove negation" case (`!expr` → `expr`) is implicitly covered: adding `!` to the inner expression of `!expr` produces `!(!expr)` = `expr`
- Boolean variable/parameter inversion is handled directly by `MutflowIrTransformer.visitGetValue`
  - `varName` → `!varName` (1 variant: wraps boolean `IrGetValue` in `Boolean.not()`)
  - Not an operator interface — `IrGetValue` is a leaf node, handled inline with a single mutation point
- `BooleanLogicOperator` swaps boolean logic operators
  - `&&` → `||` (1 variant: swaps branch results to short-circuit true)
  - `||` → `&&` (1 variant: swaps branch results to short-circuit false)
  - In K2 IR (2.3.0+), `&&` and `||` are lowered to `IrWhen` expressions with ANDAND/OROR origins
  - `&&`: `when(ANDAND) { a -> b; else -> false }` — if first is true, evaluate second
  - `||`: `when(OROR) { a -> true; else -> b }` — if first is true, short-circuit true
  - Mutation swaps branch results: ANDAND replaces `b` with `true` and `false` with `b` (and vice versa for OROR)
- `VoidFunctionBodyOperator` removes entire function bodies of Unit/void functions
  - Produces 1 variant: empty body (all side effects removed)
  - Only matches functions that return Unit, have non-empty bodies, and are not property accessors
  - Catches tests that don't verify side effects — "what if this function did nothing?"
  - Operates at the function declaration level, not at call sites
- Recursive operator application: multiple operators can match the same expression
- Type-agnostic: works with `Int`, `Long`, `Double`, `Float`, etc.
- Respects `@SuppressMutations` annotation on classes and functions
- Comment-based line suppression: `// mutflow:ignore` and `// mutflow:falsePositive`
  - Reads source files for `@MutationTarget` classes during IR transformation
  - Inline comments suppress mutations on the same line, standalone comments suppress the next line
  - Cached per file, defensive fallback with warning if source file is unreadable
- Timeout detection: injects `MutationRegistry.checkTimeout()` at the top of every loop body
  - Covers `IrWhileLoop` and `IrDoWhileLoop` (all Kotlin loop constructs including `for`)
  - Prevents mutations that cause infinite loops from hanging the test run

**mutflow-runtime:**
- `MutFlowSession`: Per-class state (discovered points, touch counts, tested mutations)
- `MutFlow`: Session management + `underTest()` API (parameterless and explicit versions)
- Thread-to-session routing: `startRun`/`endRun` register/deregister the calling thread for parameterless `underTest()` resolution
- Selection strategies: `PureRandom`, `MostLikelyRandom`, `MostLikelyStable`
- Shuffle modes: `PerRun`, `PerChange`
- Touch count tracking during baseline
- Target filtering: `includeTargets`/`excludeTargets` for scoping mutations by class
- `MutationsExhaustedException` when all mutations tested

**mutflow-junit6:**
- `@MutFlowTest` meta-annotation combining `@ClassTemplate` + `@ExtendWith`
- `MutFlowExtension` implementing `ClassTemplateInvocationContextProvider`
- Session lifecycle management (create, startRun, endRun, close)
- Mutation selection at context creation for accurate display names

**mutflow-test-sample:**
- Integration tests demonstrating both APIs

### Target API

```kotlin
// Simple: use @MutFlowTest annotation
@MutFlowTest  // runs all mutations by default
class CalculatorTest {
    @Test
    fun testIsPositive() {
        val result = MutFlow.underTest {  // parameterless!
            calculator.isPositive(5)
        }
        assertTrue(result)
    }
}
```

**Example output:**
```
CalculatorTest > Run without mutations > isPositive returns true for positive numbers() PASSED
CalculatorTest > Run without mutations > isPositive returns true at boundary() PASSED
CalculatorTest > Run without mutations > isPositive returns false for negative numbers() PASSED
CalculatorTest > Run without mutations > isPositive returns false for zero() PASSED

CalculatorTest > Mutation: (Calculator.kt:7) > → >= > ... PASSED
CalculatorTest > Mutation: (Calculator.kt:7) > → < > ... PASSED
CalculatorTest > Mutation: (Calculator.kt:7) 0 → 1 > ... PASSED
CalculatorTest > Mutation: (Calculator.kt:7) 0 → -1 > ... PASSED

```

**Key behavior:**
- **Killed mutations**: When a test assertion fails during a mutation run, the exception is **swallowed** and the test appears as PASSED. This is intentional — a failing assertion means the test caught the mutation (good!). The mutation is recorded as "killed" internally.
- **Surviving mutations**: After all tests in a mutation run complete, if NO test caught the mutation (all tests passed naturally), `MutantSurvivedException` is thrown. This fails the build and indicates a gap in test coverage.
- **Summary**: At the end of each test class, a summary shows which mutations were tested and their results.

**Why this design?**
The goal is that **all tests appear green when mutations are properly killed**. Failed assertions during mutation runs are expected and desirable — they prove your tests can detect code changes. Only when tests fail to catch a mutation does the build fail, alerting you to the coverage gap.

**Transformation:**
```kotlin
// Before (in @MutationTarget class)
fun isPositive(x: Int) = x > 0

// After compiler plugin (nested mutations for operator AND constant)
fun isPositive(x: Int) = when (MutationRegistry.check("..._0", 2, "Calculator.kt:7", ">", ">=,<", 1)) {
    0 -> x >= 0   // operator: boundary (include equality)
    1 -> x < 0    // operator: direction flip
    else -> when (MutationRegistry.check("..._1", 2, "Calculator.kt:7", "0", "1,-1", 1)) {
        0 -> x > 1    // constant: increment
        1 -> x > -1   // constant: decrement
        else -> x > 0 // original
    }
}
```

### Planned

- Gradle plugin for easy setup
- Smarter likelihood calculations (see below)
- State invalidation hooks

#### Smarter Likelihood Calculations

The current touch count metric is a simple proxy for "how well tested is this mutation point". A future improvement is enhancing the likelihood calculation by analyzing observed runtime values during baseline.

**Simple cases** (e.g., `x > 5` where one side is a literal):
- Track observed values of `x` during baseline
- If tests only use values far from the boundary (e.g., `[10, 20, 100]` but never `[4, 5, 6]`), specific variants become higher likelihood:
  - `x >= 5` → HIGH likelihood (boundary at 5 never tested)
  - `x == 5` → HIGH likelihood (5 never observed)
  - `x < 5` → LOWER likelihood (tests with x=10 would fail)

**Complex cases** (nested expressions, non-literal boundaries):
- `(x + y) > threshold` — harder to analyze, would need to track computed values
- These cases may remain suboptimal, falling back to basic touch count

The key insight: instead of a separate "boundary analysis" feature with its own warnings/control flow, we integrate this into the existing likelihood score. Boundary-untested variants naturally bubble to the top of selection priority, get tested first, and produce standard "mutation survived" feedback if they survive.

This keeps the system focused on mutation testing rather than becoming a general boundary testing tool.

## Open Questions

- Best approach for counting mutations inside loops/recursion? (per-invocation vs per-source-location)
- How to present surviving mutants clearly in test output? (IDE integration?)
