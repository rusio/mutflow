# Changelog

## [0.8.0] - 2026-03-03
### Changed
- Boolean inversion operator simplified — always adds `!` instead of two cases (remove/add). The "remove negation" case is implicit: `!(!expr)` = `expr`
- Boolean inversion now matches property accesses in addition to plain function calls
### Added
- Boolean variable/parameter inversion — boolean variables and parameters are now mutated (`varName → !varName`)

## [0.7.0] - 2026-03-02
### Added
- Boolean inversion mutation operator (`!expr` → `expr`, `expr` → `!expr`)
  - Removes `!` from any negated boolean expression
  - Adds `!` to plain boolean function calls (not comparisons or logic operators, which are already covered by other mutations)

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-27
### Changed
- All mutation points are now tested by default (`maxRuns` defaults to all instead of 5)
- Removed `selection` and `shuffle` parameters from `@MutFlowTest` — simpler API, less configuration needed

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-13
### Added
- Mutation timeout support to prevent infinite loops caused by condition mutations
  - Configurable per-mutation timeout via `@MutFlowTest(timeout = ...)` and `MutFlow.configure(timeout = ...)`
  - Timed-out mutations fail the test with a hint to deactivate the mutation on that line, preventing silent accumulation of long-running mutations

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-13
### Added
- Thread-safe mutation session to support concurrent test execution
- Gradle setting to disable mutation injection while keeping test structure intact

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-12
### Added
- Boolean logic swap mutation operator (`&&` <-> `||`)
- Fine-grained locking for safe parallel execution of mutation tests

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-10
### Added
- Equality/inequality swap mutation operator (`==` <-> `!=`)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-09
### Added
- Initial release
- Relational comparison mutations (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`)
- Constant boundary mutations
- Arithmetic operator mutations (`+` <-> `-`, `*` <-> `/`, `%` <-> `/`)
- Boolean return mutations
- Nullable return mutations (always return `null`)
- Void function body mutations (replace body with empty body)
- JUnit 6 extension with `@MutFlowTest`
- Include/exclude filters for `@MutFlowTest`
- `@MutFlowIgnore` annotation for suppressing mutations on specific lines
- Gradle plugin for easy integration
